# fltk-float

A layout library for fltk-rs that aims to reduce the amount of boilerplate code when trying to lay
out widgets so they are auto-sized to their minimal size.

NOTE: The current pre-release is meant for my own personal use in my BUGLE project and isn't ready
for wider adoption. I intend to add tests, documentation, and additional features, but until I've
done that, use this crate at your own risk.
